# SENSOR-FAULT-DETECTION

The Air pressure system (APS) is a crtical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benifits of using an APS instead of a hydraulic system are the easy availability and long term sustainability of natural air.
