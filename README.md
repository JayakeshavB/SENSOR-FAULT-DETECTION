# SENSOR-FAULT-DETECTION

We have developed an end-to-end machine learning project for sensor fault detection in the Air Pressure System (APS) of heavy-duty vehicles. The project uses sensor data to monitor pressure, temperature, and position of the piston, to detect any discrepancies indicating sensor faults. This is important for ensuring the safe and efficient operation of the vehicle, and preventing reduced braking performance and increased wear on brake pads.
